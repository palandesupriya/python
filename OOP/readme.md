Pillars of OOP:
(1)Abstraction
(2)Encapsulation
(3)Polymorphism
(4)Inheritance

Object: An instance of a template.

For python, class is also an object, but in other languages class is template.

Every object has :
  (1)Identity(for ex Adhar number)
  (2)State(fixed or dynamic) - values of the attributes at given point of time. Some attributes do not change and some attributes change.
  (3)Responsibility
  (4)Behaviour - Every object has responsibility and they achieve it through behaviour.
