Pillars of OOP:
(1)Abstraction
(2)Encapsulation
(3)Polymorphism
(4)Inheritance

Object: An instance of a template.

For python, class is also an object, but in other languages class is template.

Every object has :
  (1)Identity(for ex Adhar number)
  (2)State(fixed or dynamic) - values of the attributes at given point of time. Some attributes do not change and some attributes change.
  (3)Responsibility
  (4)Behaviour - Every object has responsibility and they achieve it through behaviour.
  
Class contains:
	(1) Manager methods:
      Constuctor  : __init__ or __new__
	  	destructor  : __del__
      
  (2) Accessor methods / getter methods:
      Accessing the state of object using getter.
      Ex: getStudentName()
      
  (3) Mutator / setter methods:
      Changing the state of object using setter.
      Ex: setStudentName()
      
  (4) Attributes:
      4.1 Object Attributes(Present per object)
      4.2 Class attributes(Common for all objects like a static member variable in c++)
